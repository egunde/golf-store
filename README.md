This is a Next.js e-commerce store that implements the Shopify Storefront API.

The demo can be viewed at colorstrike.vercel.app. To access checkout, use the password ```colorstrike```. It may redirect you to a Shopify homepage after entering the password. If so, return to the main page of the Colorstrike website and checkout again. It should direct you to your unique checkout link.

To complete the checkout, use 1 for the credit card number and fill in any other fields with any valid info.
